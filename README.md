# CRUD-Driver
CMPSC 311 project to simulate a hard drive driver

This project was done in linux virtual machine using C. 
The goal was to manage memory and manipulate meta-data in order to recreate what a hard drive does.
The work that I did in order to simulate the CRUD functionality of a hard drive is located in the hdd_file_io.c file.
The file is uneditied since sumbitting the project so be aware of the numerous amount of print statments from debugging.
The other files were apart of the black box as well as given inputs and resulting outputs from the program.
All of the files in the repo were in the final submission of the project except for 1 file due to github's file size limit.
Unfortunately the program will not run without the file.
This repository is private in case the professor wishes to use this project again in future courses.
